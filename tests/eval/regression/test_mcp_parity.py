"""MCP server parity + error-surface regression evals.

Two past incidents pinned here:

* 踩坑 #34 — the MCP tool surface drifted from the documented tool table
  (CLI had clone/migrate/snapshot, MCP silently didn't). The parity tests
  assert the registered tool count and read/write split match SKILL.md's
  declaration ("MCP Tools (27 — 20 read, 7 write)").

* v1.5.34 follow-up — the connection layer's teaching errors (AriaApiError:
  "404 → list the parent collection first", "503 → platform booting") were
  collapsed to "AriaApiError: operation failed." by _safe_error's allowlist,
  so agents never saw the remediation hint.
